            After years of band attempts and projects dating back to high school days, a career in music for the members of Disco Stranger didn’t look so promising. After a few long months and a little bit of luck the origin of the group was born. Disco Stranger originally started out as a cover band under the name "Steve French and Company" until they heard one too many “PLAY KID ROCK!” requests and decided to write our own original material. The band name is an ode to the Eagles and their song “Disco Strangler”, a band they covered quite a bit and grew up on.
            <br><br>
            The years of playing together have allowed them to blend their favorite influences from songs they have learned in the past into their own form of music, which are warm, catchy songs with elements of spacey reverb, tape delay, and explosive jam sets.
